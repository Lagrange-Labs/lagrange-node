# Contributing
* Standard practice is for feature branch pull requests to be created against the `develop` branch.
* Verify that all changes comply with the linter, and that all unit tests are passing, both locally and in Github's CI.
* Functions internally used within modules should not be public.
* All functionality changes are encouraged to have accompanying unit tests.
